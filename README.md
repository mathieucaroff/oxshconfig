# oxshconf

Mathieu CAROFF's dusty sh configuration, leveraging [shconf](https://github.com/mathieucaroff/shconf), which brings better support for having .zshrc, .bashrc and .profile in a single repository (and support for much more actually).

You may want to take a peak inside `60-function.d`, there are some juicy, useful functions, but be warned that there also are some pretty useless ones (and it's hard to tell one from another).
